####  Anchors — ^ and $  ############

^The        ; matches any string that starts with The
end$        ;matches a string that ends with end
^The end$   ;exact string match (starts and ends with The end)



####  Quantifiers — * + ? and {}  ##########

The quantifiers ( * + {}) are greedy operators, so they expand the match as far as they can through the provided text.


A regex quantifier is a symbol or a character sequence that defines the number of times a character or a group of characters can appear in a regular expression. 
Quantifiers are used to make regular expressions more concise and powerful, allowing you to match repeated patterns in text.

There are several types of quantifiers in regular expressions, including:

The asterisk (*) - matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group of characters.
The plus sign (+) - matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group of characters.
The question mark (?) - matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group of characters.
Curly braces ({}) - allow you to specify a specific number of occurrences of the preceding character or group of characters.
The dot (.) - matches any single character.

abc*        matches a string that has ab followed by zero or more c 
abc+        matches a string that has ab followed by one or more c
abc?        matches a string that has ab followed by zero or one c
abc{2}      matches a string that has ab followed by 2 c
abc{2,}     matches a string that has ab followed by 2 or more c
abc{2,5}    matches a string that has ab followed by 2 up to 5 c
a(bc)*      matches a string that has a followed by zero or more copies of the sequence bc
a(bc){2,5}  matches a string that has a followed by 2 up to 5 copies of the sequence bc

eg.   <.+>    matches    <div>simple div</div>
- < matches the character <
- . matches any character (except for line terminators)
- + matches the previous token between one and unlimited times
- > matches the character >



#### OR operator — | or [] ###########################

a(b|c)     matches a string that has a followed by b or c (and captures b or c)
a[bc]      same as previous, but without capturing b or c

# [] is different than ()

#### Character classes — \d \w \s and .  ###################

\d         matches a single character that is a digit 
\w         matches a word character (alphanumeric character plus underscore) 
\s         matches a whitespace character (includes tabs and line breaks)
.          matches any character 



#### Boundaries — \b and \B  #####################################

\babc\b          performs a "whole words only" search

\bChung\b        matches "Tu Chung" but not "TuChung"



#### Escape characters #############################
In order to be taken literally, you must escape the characters ^.[$()|*+?{\with a backslash \ as they have special meaning.

\$\d       matches a string that has a $ before one digit

# "Tu is the absolute best"

# \b[a-z]\w+    -> is , the , absolute , best
## A word that contains letters a single char between a-z
## \w matches any word character (equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]) unlimited times

# \b[a-z]\w     -> is  , th , ab , be
## A word that contains a single character in the range a-z
## \w matches any word character (equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_])

# \b[a-z]       -> i , t , a , b
# A word that contains letters a single char between a-z

# \b[ab]\w+     -> absolute , best
# A word that contains letters a single char that is either 'a' or 'b'
## w matches any word character (equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]) unlimited times

#\b[a]\w+       -> absolute
## find a word that starts with the letter 'a'
