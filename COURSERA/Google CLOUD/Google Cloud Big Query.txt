# BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. 
# With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to
# manage or needing a database administrator. BigQuery uses SQL and can take advantage of the pay-as-you-go mode

### QWIKLABS Steps to add local CSV and Cloud Storage CSV to BIg Query #######
# Check goodnotes for screenshots

## Task 1. Create a new dataset to store tables ######

To create a dataset, click on the View actions icon (the three vertical dots) next to your project ID and select Create dataset.

Next, name your Dataset ID nyctaxi and leave all other options at their default values, and then click Create dataset.

You'll now see the nyctaxi dataset under your project name.


## Task 2. Ingest a new dataset from a CSV ########
Download a subset of the NYC taxi 2018 trips data locally onto your computer

In the BigQuery Console, Select the nyctaxi dataset then click Create Table

Specify the below table options:

Source:

Create table from: Upload
Choose File: select the file you downloaded locally earlier
File format: CSV
Destination:

Table name: 2018trips Leave all other settings at default.
Schema:

Check Auto Detect (tip: Not seeing the checkbox? Ensure the file format is CSV and not Avro)
Advanced Options

Leave at default values
Click Create Table.

You should now see the 2018trips table below the nyctaxi dataset.

############################################
In the Query Editor, write a query to list the top 5 most expensive trips of the year:

#standardSQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  nyctaxi.2018trips
ORDER BY
  fare_amount DESC
LIMIT  5

#############################################


#### Task 3. Ingest a new dataset from Google Cloud Storage  ############

# Need to use BQ
# The bq command-line tool is a Python-based command-line tool for BigQuery

bq load \
--source_format=CSV \
--autodetect \
--noreplace  \
nyctaxi.2018trips \
gs://cloud-training/OCBL013/nyc_tlc_yellow_trips_2018_subset_2.csv



### Task 4. Create tables from other tables with DDL ##############
The 2018trips table now has trips from throughout the year. What if you were only interested in January trips? 
For the purpose of this lab, we will keep it simple and focus only on pickup date and time. 
Let's use DDL to extract this data and store it in another table

#standardSQL
CREATE TABLE
  nyctaxi.january_trips AS
SELECT
  *
FROM
  nyctaxi.2018trips
WHERE
  EXTRACT(Month
  FROM
    pickup_datetime)=1;
