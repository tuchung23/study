# Interpreted languages trade off slightly slower runtime performance—removing the need for compiling—by using programs called interpreters to execute the code.

# Managing files with python

########################

# A "File Descriptor" is a token, generated by the OS, that allows programs to do more operations with the file

############ Open and read a file contents##########################
# read only mode is the default so no need to specify
file=open("c:\\temp\\Friends.txt")
# The readline() method reads a single line from the current position, the read() method reads from the current position until the end of the file.
print(file.readline())

# Read from the current position to the end of the file
print(file.read())

# close the file which is good practice
# this unlocks the file 
# using a WITH block automatically closes the file for us
file.close()

## Iterating through files########
# with opens and closes files for us
# make file contents upper case
with open("c:\\temp\\Friends.txt") as file:
    for line in file:
        # the strip() command is used to remove extra whitespace.
        print(line.strip().upper())



## Read file contents into a LIST ##
file=open("c:\\temp\\Friends.txt")
lines=file.readlines()
file.close()
# sort it alphabetically
lines.sort()
print(lines)

## Writing to files########
# use 'w' mode to write
# use 'a' mode to append
# use 'r+' mode to read and write
# if files doesnt exist, it will be created
# if it does exist, it will be overwritten as soon as the file is opened

# READ and WRITE first lab exercise
# Below is my working solution

##################

# Practice Notebook: Reading and Writing Files

# In this exercise, we will test your knowledge of reading and writing files by playing around with some text files. 
# Let's say we have a text file containing current visitors at a hotel.  We'll call it, *guests.txt*.  
# Run the following code to create the file.  The file will automatically populate with each initial guest's first name on its own line.


####### Tip - to run specific section of code in VSCODE ############
# highlight the code
# hold SHIFT and press enter
# exit prompt by CTRL-Z plus enter



# \\ to preserve character
guests = open("c:\\temp\\guests.txt", "w")
# this creates a new file if not exists
initial_guests = ["Bob", "Andrea", "Manuel", "Polly", "Khalid"]

# iterate the list and enter one name per line
for i in initial_guests:
    guests.write(i + "\n")
    
guests.close()

## this returns
# Bob
# Andrea
# Manuel
# Polly
# Khalid

# grab contents of the file and print to stdout
with open("c:\\temp\\guests.txt") as guests:
    for line in guests:
        print(line)



# Now suppose we want to update our file as guests check in and out.  Fill in the missing code in the following cell to add guests to the *guests.txt* file as they check in.

# define the list of new guests
new_guests = ["Sam", "Danielle", "Jacob"]

# we want to append whats already there, so use 'a' descriptor
with open("c:\\temp\\guests.txt", 'a') as guests:
    for i in new_guests:
        guests.write(i + "\n")

guests.close()


# now output file contents to stdout
with open("c:\\temp\\guests.txt") as guests:
    for line in guests:
        print(line)


# Now let's remove the guests that have checked out already.  There are several ways to do this, however, the method we will choose for this exercise is outlined as follows:
# 1. Open the file in "read" mode.
# 2. Iterate over each line in the file and put each guest's name into a Python list.
# 3. Open the file once again in "write" mode.
# 4. Add each guest's name in the Python list to the file one by one.

checked_out=["Andrea", "Manuel", "Khalid"]
temp_list=[]

with open("c:\\temp\\guests.txt", 'r') as guests:
    for g in guests:
        temp_list.append(g.strip())

# remove the users from the checked_out list
with open("c:\\temp\\guests.txt", 'w') as guests:
    for name in temp_list:
        # this compares 2 lists to each other
        if name not in checked_out:
            guests.write(name + "\n")



with open("c:\\temp\\guests.txt") as guests:
    for line in guests:
        print(line)


# The current names in the *guests.txt* file should be:  Bob, Polly, Sam, Danielle and Jacob.

# Now let's check whether Bob and Andrea are still checked in.  
# How could we do this? We'll just read through each line in the file to see if their name is in there.  
# Run the following code to check whether Bob and Andrea are still checked in.

guests_to_check = ['Bob', 'Andrea']
checked_in = []

with open("c:\\temp\\guests.txt","r") as guests:
    for g in guests:
        checked_in.append(g.strip())
    for check in guests_to_check:
        if check in checked_in:
            print("{} is checked in".format(check))
        else:
            print("{} is not checked in".format(check))


# We can see that Bob is checked in while Andrea is not.  Nice work! You've learned the basics of reading and writing files in Python!

############
# CSV writer() example

# Example - Define the data to be written to the CSV file from lists
data = [["Name", "Age", "City"],

###################
# csv reader() example
#
##################
# The reader() function of the CSV module will interpret the file as a CSV.
# Open the file for reading
with open("c:\\temp\\example.csv", "r") as file:

# Read and write into dictionaries
######################

# DictReader() allows us to convert the data in a CSV file into a standard dictionary. 
# DictWriter() allows us to write data from a dictionary into a CSV file.
# The fieldnames parameter of DictWriter() requires a list of keys
# as this will help DictWriter() organize the CSV rows properly

# Here's an example of how to use the csv.DictReader class in Python to read a CSV file into a list of dictionaries:

with open('c:\\temp\\example.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    data = list(reader)

print(data)

# this returns
# [{'Name': 'John Doe', 'Age': '32', 'City': 'New York'}, {'Name': 'Jane Doe', 'Age': '35', 'City': 'London'}]
