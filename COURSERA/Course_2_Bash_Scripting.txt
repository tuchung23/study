## redirecting streams ####
# Redirection is the process of sending a stream to a different destination
# use >  to redirect  ; >> to append
# use < to read input from a file instead of keyboard
# redirerect error output using 2>error_file.txt  , so it appears in file instead of screen

## pipes and pipelines ####
# pipes connect the output of one program to the input of another in order to pass data between
# the programs
# eg. input_text | ./program.py

## Signals ###
# tokens delivered to running processes to indicate a desired action

# CTRL-C -> sigint ; This sends a SIGINT signal to the program to stop processing cleanly
# CTRL-Z  -> sigstop
# kill -> sigterm , terminate



###############
# Basic commands
###############



chown user files: changes the owner of the files to the given user

chgrp group files: changes the group of the files to the given group

## Operating with the content of files ##
cat file: shows the content of the file through standard output

wc file: counts the amount of characters, words, and lines in the given file; can also count the same values of whatever it receives via stdin

file file: prints the type of the given file, as recognized by the operating system

head file: shows the first 10 lines of the given file

tail file: shows the last 10 lines of the given file

less file: scrolls through the contents of the given file (press "q" to quit)

sort file: sorts the lines of the file alphabetically

cut -dseparator -ffields file: for each line in the given file, splits the line according to the given separator and prints the given fields (starting from 1)

## Additional commands ##
echo "message": prints the message to standard output

date: prints the current date

who: prints the list of users currently logged into the computer

man command: shows the manual page of the given command; manual pages contain a lot of information explaining how to use each command (press "q" to quit)

uptime: shows how long the computer has been running

free: shows the amount of unused memory on the current system

## Managing streams ##
These are the redirectors that we can use to take control of the streams of our programs

command > file: redirects standard output, overwrites file

command >> file: redirects standard output, appends to file

command < file: redirects standard input from file

command 2> file: redirects standard error to file

command1 | command2: connects the output of command1 to the input of command2

## Operating with processes ##
These are some commands that are useful to know in Linux when interacting with processes. Not all of them are explained in videos, so feel free to investigate them on your own.

ps: lists the processes executing in the current terminal for the current user

ps ax: lists all processes currently executing for all users  

ps e: shows the environment for the processes listed  

kill PID: sends the SIGTERM signal to the process identified by PID

fg: causes a job that was stopped or in the background to return to the foreground

bg: causes a job that was stopped to go to the background

jobs: lists the jobs currently running or stopped

top: shows the processes currently using the most CPU time (press "q" to quit)

# Creating BASH scripts
#
###################################

# bash is the most commonly used shell on Linux. Bash is not only the interpreter that runs our commands, it's also a scripting language
# it has the .sh extension

## variables ##
example=hello
echo $example

## GLOBS ##
Globs are characters that allow us to create list of files. The star and question mark are the most common globs

## conditional exection ########
# IF #
# if [condition]; then
# else
# fi




#!/bin/bash

if grep "127.0.0.1" /etc/host; then 
    echo "Everything OK"
else    
    echo "ERROR! 127.0.0.1 is not in /etc/hosts"
fi     


## TEST command ##
Test is a command that evaluates the conditions received and exits with zero when they are true and with one when they're false

$ if test -n "$PATH"; then echo "Your path is not empty"; fi 

## WHILE loops #### 
#  while [condition]; do
#  done
#

example:
while [ $n -le 9 ]; do

# le is less than or equal to
# lt is larger than
# ge is greater or equal to
etc


## FOR loops ###
# for [condition]; do
# done
#

Example:
for fruit in peach orange apple; do
     echo "I like $fruit!"
done


Example script to rename files with .HTM to .htm:

for file in *.HTM; do   
    name=$(basename "$file" .HTM)
    #basename is a built in command that strips the extension
    echo mv "$file" "$name.html"
    # adding echo is good test before doing actually commands on files
done



## Arguments in BASH ##
# $1 $2 etc


## Advanced command interaction ###################
#
####################################################
# CUT command

Example file is data.txt containing:
John,Smith,25,555-1234
Jane,Doe,30,555-5678
Bob,Johnson,40,555-9012

You can use cut to extract specific fields from each line of the file

For example, if you only want to extract the first and last names, you can use the following command:

$ cut -d ',' -f 1,2 data.txt

-d ',': the delimiter is set to a comma
-f 1,2: the fields you want to extract are 1 (the first name) and 2 (the last name)
data.txt: the file you want to extract the fields from


###############################################
# Choosing between bash and python
#
###############################################
# it's a good idea to choose bash when we're operating with files and system commands, as long as what we're doing is simple enough 
# that the script is self-explanatory. 
# As soon as it becomes hard to understand what the script is doing, it's better to write it in a more general scripting language like Python. 
# Bash scripts aren't as flexible or robust as having entire Python language available, with its many functions to operate on strings, lists, and dictionaries.

# if your code is complex or it needs to work across platforms, you might be better off using the Python standard library or other external 
# modules that provide the same functionality.

###########################################
# QWIKLABS
#
###########################################
# In this lab, you'll change the username of your coworker Jane Doe from "jane" to "jdoe" in compliance with company's naming policy. 
# The username change has already been done. However, some files that were named with Jane's previous username "jane" haven't been updated yet. 
# To help with this, you'll write a bash script and a Python script that will take care of the necessary rename operations.

Example "list.txt" file:
001 janes /data/jane_profile_07272018.doc

Samples to help with this project:

GREP and CUT:
$ grep " jane " .list.txt | cut -d ' ' -f 2

TEST expression:
# -e flag checks if a file exists
$ if test -e ~/data/jane_profile_07272018.doc; then echo "File exists"; else echo "File doesn't exist"; fi

CREATE empty file
$ touch new_file.txt
OR
$ > new_file.txt

ITERATION:
$ for i in 1 2 3; do echo $i; done

### Task 1 ###########
# oldFiles.txt file should save files with username "jane" into a variable called "files"

$ file=grep " jane " ../data/list.txt | cut -d ' ' -f 3


### Task 2 ###########
#  check if file names present in files variable are actually present in the file system using test Command

$ if test -e $file; then echo "File exists"; else echo "File doesn't exist"; fi


### Task 3 ############
# In this section, you are going to write a Python script, changeJane.py, that takes oldFiles.txt as a command line 
argument and then renames files with the new username "jdoe". You will be completing the script, but we will guide throughout the section.

# Since oldFiles.txt is passed as a command line argument, it's stored in the variable sys.argv[1]. Open the file from the first argument to 
read its contents using open() method. You can either assign it to a variable or use a with block. 
Hint: traverse each line in the file using readlines() method. Use line.strip() to remove any whitespaces or newlines and fetch the old name.


########################################################
# oldfiles.txt should contain:
/data/jane_profile_07272018.doc
/data/jane_contact_07292018.csv
##########################################################
findjane.sh:

#!/bin/bash
> oldFiles.txt   
file=`grep " jane " ../data/list.txt | cut -d ' ' -f 3`

#iterate through the $file variable
for line in $file  ; do
    if test -e ~/$line;then
        echo $line >> oldFiles.txt
    fi 
done    


############################################################




##############################################################
# Use Python to rename the files

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
import subprocess

## task 4 ####
# open oldfile.txt for reading as first argument


with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as file:
    rows=file.readlines()
    for row in rows:
        original_string=row.strip()
        new_string=original_string.replace("jane","jdoe")

# Once you have the old name, use replace() function to replace "jane" with "jdoe". This method replaces occurrences of any older substring with the new substring. 
The old and new substrings are passed as parameters to the function. 
Therefore, it returns a string where all occurrences of the old substring is replaced with the new substring.

$ string.replace(old_substring, new_substring)

eg. 
original_string = "Hello, world!"
new_string = original_string.replace("world", "python")
print(new_string)



## Now, invoke a subprocess by calling run() function. This function takes arguments used to launch the process. These arguments may be a list or a string.
# You should pass a list consisting of the mv command, followed by the variable storing the old name and new name respectively to the run() function 
# within the subprocess module

$ subprocess.run(['mv' , original_string , new_string ], capture_output=True)
$ file.close()


## Run the script and pass the file oldFiles.txt as a command line argument.

$ ./changeJane.py oldFiles.txt
